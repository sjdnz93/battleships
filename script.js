//!ELEMENTS TO TARGET
  //?Start button
    //Will need to be able to target the start button to begin the game
    //This should trigger a function that randomly places the computer's boats
    //Should also enable the player to position their boats on the page, perhaps making the boards clickable

  //?Rules div
    //Text updates from rules of game to then contain text saying "Place your X" as player rotates through placing each ship
    //Should contain fixed text that explains controls to rotate the boat around its axis

  //?Grid squares
    //First interaction with grid will be for player to place their boats. Probably only focus on one square at a time in terms of hover and clicks, but figure out a way to highlight multiple squares based on the size of the boat that's about to be placed (THINK ABOUT BOTH HOVER EVENTS AND CLICKS)
    //At this point there'll need to be a function and listener that will rotate the boat 90deg so can be placed horizontally or vertically
    //Grid squares will also need to be able to accept and track clicks in order to find enemy boats. (THIS WILL NEED TO WORK FOR BOTH PLAYER AND COMPUTER SHOTS)
  
  //?Boat placeholders (top and bottom of page)
    //Boat placeholders will need to illuminate when you're placing the boat at the beginning of the game 
    //and then again in a different colour when it has been destroyed

//!GLOBAL VARIABLES

  //?playerBoatsPlaced
    //start at 0

  //?playerBoatsRemaining
    //number -> probs end up equalling playerBoatsPlaced once all boats are placed

  //?compBoatsPlaced
    //not sure about this one
    //could be a number or a boolean

  //?compBoatsRemaining
    //number
